## Concept

The website is designed to be a blog, essentially a playful and informative space to guide incoming freshmen through their first year of college. It combines fun anecdotes, tips, and a bit of humor to create an engaging experience, offering insights on everything from walking around campus to finding the best spots to eat. It's a welcoming place where readers can learn about being demure and mindful during their freshman year. The "very mindful, very demure" short film/trend created adds to the blog's fun and playful style. IN addition to that it shows characters that reflect these qualities in daily college life, giving a light and helpful reminder to approach freshman year thoughtfully and with grace.


## Features/Implementation Process
I began by using the [Tooplate-barista template](https://www.tooplate.com/view/2137-barista-cafe) as a base for the website. This allowed me to work with a pre-structured design, but I made numerous adjustments to ensure it aligned with my unique vision: 


  - **Hover Effects**: I customized the CSS file to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. This included not only changing the overall color scheme, but also customizing the buttons and enhancing the hover effects by setting the --custom-btn-bg-hover-color to align with the NYU color scheme. I implemented more styling adjustments, ensuring that the hover effects provide dynamic visual feedback, making the buttons feel more interactive and responsive.

  - **Carousel**: The carousel is equipped with buttons that lead users to different posts. By clicking through, users can easily discover various blog entries.
    
  - **Accordion Feature**: On the About Us page, I implemented accordion-style functionality using a combination of CSS and JavaScript. This feature adds a layer of interactivity to the page. The accordion design allows users to click on a button for each team member, revealing more information without cluttering the page.

  - **FAQ Section**: I implemented a toggle effect for the FAQ section, allowing users to click on questions to reveal answers. This keeps the page tidy and enhances user engagement.

  - **Contact Information**:  I added a contact section where users can click on the email addresses, which will directly lead to their email client. This feature makes it easy for visitors to reach out.

  - **Multimedia Content**: Embedded videos for a richer user experience.
  - **Cutesy Design**: Utilizes oval-shaped images and a Didot font for a refined look.


## Reflection
In building the final working version of the website, I had specific expectations and goals in mind, including the implementation of interactive features, the customization of design elements, and the creation of a smooth user experience. I’m pleased to say that I was able to meet many of these goals successfully.

One key feature I aimed to include was a "Subscribe to Newsletter" option, which can be seen in my initial wireframe. This would allow users to easily stay updated with new posts and announcement and keep them engaged. However, as I started to try to implement this feature, I quickly realized that this functionality required more advanced coding skills, particularly in Python, which is outside the current scope of my expertise.

While this was a bit of a setback, it provided me with insight into areas for growth in the future. To keep things moving though, I decided to scale back and include a "Contact Us" section instead. This allows users to click on an email link that automatically opens their email client, making it easy for them to reach out directly. It’s a simpler solution but still keeps users engaged with the platform.

Additionally, I made the decision to remove the original guides page that can be seen in the wireframe, and replace it with a FAQ section. This change better aligns with the blog's quick and informal style, making it easier for users to find answers to common questions in a friendly format. The FAQ section allows for a more interactive experience, encouraging users to engage with the content in a lighthearted way. This adjustment not only enhances the usability of the site but also fits the overall theme of providing accessible and relatable information for incoming freshmen.
